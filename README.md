Am learning python through projects :
Today i will be building a madlibs game 
Madlib is a phrasal template word game where one player prompts others for a list of word to substitute for blank in a story.
I will be building an interface for the game using tkinter for now.
I might come back and improve it if i learn about other concepts.
